## Adrienne Li

Welcome to my page!

### About

I am a clinical postdoc fellow with [Dr. Shayna Rosenbaum](http://www.yorku.ca/shaynar/Dr.R.ShaynaRosenbaum.htm) at York University, Toronto and [Dr. Robin Green](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/psych/robin-green-phd-cpsych) at UHN-Toronto Rehab Institute.

I completed my professional training in clinical psychology at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-psychology-doctorate/) and my doctoral research was supervised by [Dr. John King](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=JAKIN44). I explored the neural correlates of spatial (object location) memory using immersive virtual reality in healthy older adults, Mild Cognitive Impairment and early Alzheimer's disease.
